## How to play?

Keep your fac member happy by giving them compliments, advising them or feeding them. 
Be careful! If you ignore them, thereâ€™s a timer that will knock points off you. 
Get to 50 points to win! Go below zero and your fac member will quit!

## Concept and Idea
Fac mentoring tamagochi with buttons to advise, compliment or feed 
Scores increments when mentor is nice and decrements if ignored

## APIs to use 
- Who will you mentor (choose GitHub api) 
- Offer advice https://api.adviceslip.com/
- Cheer them up https://complimentr.com/api

## Work Process
- Came up with ideas based on easy APIs to use
- Did the Kanban board and organised how we'd work
- Set up and deployment with Vite and Netlify (according to instructions) 
- Did a Figma 
- Used React and Fetch workshop to build first Profile and getting the FAC member
- Built button components, querying Apis 
- Built timer/decrement score functionality based on workshop online
- CSS/Readme 

## Project
The goal is to build an interactive game-like thing that uses data from an API.

### Criteria 
- [x] Accept some user input (e.g. a username)
- [x] Query an API (e.g. the Github API, or any other fun one)
- [x] Populate the UI with API data
- [x] Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g.
A hunger bar that decreases over time and is topped up when you feed them stars
A button to add more users to your collect

Stretch criteria 
- [ ] Save your state to localstorage so you can leave the page and come back later
- [x] Make it look great
